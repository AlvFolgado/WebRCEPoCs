Installation:

OS requirements: Linux/Windows


1. Install jdk-1.8, netbeans with spring v4
2. Open Netbeans and load the projects
3. Server is testd using glassfish


Objetive of this PoC:

1. Understand how dangerous deserialization functions with untrusted inputs are
2. The user input is passed through the cookie but also using the function /DeserializationPoC/dangerousfunction
3. PayloadGenerator once executed give to us 3 different payloads examples:

a.Payload1: very simply gadget that trigger a dangerous handler in the web page, simply paste in the cookie using a burp tool as burp.
b.Payload2: simple gadget that uses a vulnerable invocation handler. Same as payload1 for the cookie.
c. BeanShell (CVE-2016-2510). This one need to be provided as a POST atribute "session=" with target URI /DeserializationPoC/dangerousfunction. We need change symbol '+' for his URL encoded version '%2b' since it will be escaped before arriving to the backend java code.


Remember:

This is PoC, it holds vulnerable code. Use it in a controlled environment and don't follow any codings here!
